<h2> About </h2><hr>
    <p> I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Environmental Systems Sciences at ETH Z&#xFC;rich, in <a href="https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html">Heini Wernli</a>'s 
        group. My main research interest lies in 
        climate dynamics, with an emphasis on the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere.
        I strive to develop simple theories to understand the distribution of rainfall in the tropics.
        I previously obtained
        my Ph.D. in the department of Earth and Planetary Science at UC Berkeley, working with
        <a href="https://boos.berkeley.edu/">William Boos</a>. My thesis work focused 
        on the organization of rainfall around mountains, termed orographic precipitation.
    </p>
    <p> I am more broadly interested in geophysical fluid dynamics, and 
        I have had the chance to dip my toes in the world of the geodynamo, working with 
        <a href="https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/bruce-buffett">Bruce Buffett</a>
        on wave generation in Earth's outer core. I am also
        collaborating with <a href="https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/">Geoffrey Vallis</a> on the physics of superrotation.
        I met Geoff during the 
        <a href="https://gfd.whoi.edu/">Geophysical fluid dynamics summer program</a> at WHOI, where I was a fellow in 2023.
    </p>
    <p> Prior to my PhD, I earned a MS in applied mathematics at Ecole polytechnique, just south of Paris, France. 
        There, I had my first research experience developing mathematical models of the human liver with 
        <a href="https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/team-members/irene-vignon-clementel/">Irene Vignon-Clementel</a> at Inria Paris.

    <h4> Tropical orographic precipitation </h4>        
    <p> Tropical mountains are among the rainiest places on Earth. Previous theories for the enhancement of precipitation 
     by mountains (termed <i>orographic precipitation</i>) focus on midlatitude regions, and assume that it results from the 
     smooth uplift of prevailing winds by the topography. In the tropics, precipitating clouds are often associated with moist 
     convection: this means they ascend much faster and much deeper than what the mountain uplift alone could cause. We proposed 
     a theory which couples moist convection and mountain flow dynamics, allowing to understand the spatial distribution of 
     orographic precipitation in the tropics. <br>

     <div class="text-center">
     <img src="data/ghatsmaps.pdf" width="80%">
     <p><em>Precipitation distribution around the Western Ghats of India in observations (left), as given by our theory (middle left),<br>and as 
        given by two previous theories for orographic precipitation (right). From Nicolas and Boos, 2024.</em></p>
    </div>

     The theory rests on the simple idea that the seasonal-mean ascent forced by 
     topography cools and moistens the lower free troposphere, a layer located roughly 1 to 4 km above the surface. This, in turn,
     increases the buoyancy of convective clouds: it is easier for them to rise through a cooler environment, and the entrainment 
     of moister free-tropospheric air as they ascend is less effective at diluting them. We have subsequently applied 
     this theory to understand the seasonal-mean rainfall distribution in several regions of Earth's tropics, and to understand how it
     changes as the background wind strenghten or weakens - a crucial question to project rainfall changes with global warming.<br>

    <h4> Extreme wet and dry seasons in the tropics </h4>   
    <p> Extreme weather events threaten human societies across the world, but are, by far, most
        devastating in the tropics. While tropical rainfall extremes have been widely studied at the daily timescales, there has been 
        comparatively little work on seasonal-scale extremes. Are they caused by anomalously frequent wet days, or a few anomalously 
        extreme events? What are their climatological drivers? Are they associated with large changes in the frequency of certain 
        weather systems? My host group at ETH Z&#xFC;rich has tackled these questions over the past six years, with a focus on midlatitudes.
        I joined the group to address these questions in tropical regions.<br>

        One approach to understanding these is a plume buoyancy framework. Tropical extreme seasons, both wet and dry, are relatively well 
        characterized by a simple measure of convective plume buoyancy (see figure). This measure only depends on seasonal-mean temperature 
        and moisture in the boundary layer and lower free troposphere. Understanding what leads to seasonal extremes in these 
        thermodynamic quantities (processes associated with surface fluxes, horizontal moisture advection, and others) may be easier than 
        understanding directly what lead to rainfall extremes.
