<h2> About </h2><hr>
    <p> I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Environmental Systems Sciences at ETH Z&#xFC;rich, in <a href="https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html">Heini Wernli</a>'s 
        group. My main research interest lies in 
        climate dynamics, with an emphasis on the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere.
        I strive to develop simple theories to understand the distribution of rainfall in the tropics.
        I previously obtained
        my Ph.D. in the department of Earth and Planetary Science at UC Berkeley, working with
        <a href="https://boos.berkeley.edu/">William Boos</a>. My thesis work focused 
        on the organization of rainfall around mountains, termed orographic precipitation.
    </p>
    <p> I am more broadly interested in geophysical fluid dynamics, and 
        I have had the chance to dip my toes in the world of the geodynamo, working with 
        <a href="https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/bruce-buffett">Bruce Buffett</a>
        on wave generation in Earth's outer core. I am also
        collaborating with <a href="https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/">Geoffrey Vallis</a> on the physics of superrotation.
        I met Geoff during the 
        <a href="https://gfd.whoi.edu/">Geophysical fluid dynamics summer program</a> at WHOI, where I was a fellow in 2023.
    </p>
    <p> Prior to my PhD, I earned a MS in applied mathematics at Ecole polytechnique, just south of Paris, France. 
        There, I had my first research experience developing mathematical models of the human liver with 
        <a href="https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/team-members/irene-vignon-clementel/">Irene Vignon-Clementel</a> at Inria Paris.

    <h4> Tropical orographic precipitation </h4>        
    <p> Tropical mountains are among the rainiest places on Earth. Previous theories for the enhancement of precipitation 
     by mountains (termed <i>orographic precipitation</i>) focus on midlatitude regions, and assume that it results from the 
     smooth uplift of prevailing winds by the topography. In the tropics, precipitating clouds are often associated with moist 
     convection: this means they ascend much faster and much deeper than what the mountain uplift alone could cause. We proposed 
     a theory which couples moist convection and mountain flow dynamics, allowing to understand the spatial distribution of 
     orographic precipitation in the tropics. <br>

     <div class="text-center">
     <img src="data/ghatsmaps.png" width="80%">
     <p><em>Precipitation distribution around the Western Ghats of India in observations (left), as given by our theory (middle left), and as 
        given by two previous theories for orographic precipitation (right). From Nicolas and Boos, 2024.</em></p>
    </div>

     The theory rests on the simple idea that the seasonal-mean ascent forced by 
     topography cools and moistens the lower free troposphere, a layer located roughly 1 to 4 km above the surface. This, in turn,
     increases the buoyancy of convective clouds: it is easier for them to rise through a cooler environment, and the entrainment 
     of moister free-tropospheric air as they ascend is less effective at diluting them. We have subsequently applied 
     this theory to understand the seasonal-mean rainfall distribution in several regions of Earth's tropics, and to understand how it
     changes as the background wind strenghten or weakens - a crucial question to project rainfall changes with global warming.<br>

    <h4> Extreme wet and dry seasons in the tropics </h4>   
    <p> Extreme weather events threaten human societies across the world, but are, by far, most
        devastating in the tropics. While tropical rainfall extremes have been widely studied at the daily timescales, there has been 
        comparatively little work on seasonal-scale extremes. Are they caused by anomalously frequent wet days, or a few anomalously 
        extreme events? What are their climatological drivers? Are they associated with large changes in the frequency of certain 
        weather systems? My host group at ETH Z&#xFC;rich has tackled these questions over the past six years, with a focus on midlatitudes.
        I joined the group to address these questions in tropical regions.<br>

        One approach to understanding these is a plume buoyancy framework. Tropical extreme seasons, both wet and dry, are relatively well 
        characterized by a simple measure of convective plume buoyancy. This measure only depends on seasonal-mean temperature 
        and moisture in the boundary layer and lower free troposphere. Understanding what leads to seasonal extremes in these 
        thermodynamic quantities (processes associated with surface fluxes, horizontal moisture advection, and others) may be easier than 
        understanding directly what lead to rainfall extremes.

    <h4> Midlatitude heat waves </h4>   
    <p> Extreme heat events have been increasing in intensity over the past decades, with some heatwaves shattering previous 
        temperature records by more than 5°C. How much can we expect them to intensify in the near future? A recent study 
        (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215278120">Zhang and Boos, 2023</a>) suggested that 
        there is a physical upper limit to surface temperatures, set by moist convective instability. The bound they proposed has the 
        unexpected property of allowing for temperature profiles that are unstable to dry convection. We are investingating the reasons behind this
        behavior, and the characteristics of heatwaves that do feature such instability.

    <h4> Superrotation in planetary atmospheres </h4>   
    <p> Superrotation is a strange feature of some planetary atmospheres, whereby the equatorial atmosphere
        rotates faster than the underlying planet. It is observed in the atmospheres of several planetary bodies in the Solar system 
        (Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan) and is expected to occur on many exoplanets. The mechanisms
        responsible for superrotation are still debated and vary depending on a planet's characteristics.
        Our paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21680">preprint</a>) investigates 
        the mechanisms responsible for superrotation in shallow atmospheres in a simple two-layer model.
    </p><br>

    <h4> Stationary wave modeling of Earth's atmosphere </h4>   
    <p> Understanding the dynamics of Earth's atmosphere requires a range of models of varying complexity, from pen-and-paper 
        theories to complex general circulation models. Stationary wave models are an intermediate class of models designed to
        investigates the response of the atmosphere to steady forcings, such as topography or diabatic heating. One example of 
        question that a stationary wave models can help answer is whether mountains or diabatic heating are more important in 
        shaping the mean position of the jet stream. I have implemented a stationary wave model using Dedalus, a python framework
        for solving PDEs. The model is <a href="https://github.com/qnicolas/stationaryWave">freely available on Github</a>.
